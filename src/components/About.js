                As a full-stack developer, Iâ€™ve always sought innovation.
                <br /> <br /> While pursuing my graduate degree in architecture
                from Florida International University, I discovered my passion
                for programming after studying the influence of artificial
                intelligence on architectural design. Through further
                exploration and GANs programming, I developed a program that
                utilized webcam imagery to render objects into architectural
                images. I received the 1st place graduate thesis award for this
                project.
                <br /> <br /> This experience, combined with my desire to create
                innovative digital applications, pushed me to enroll in the
                Ironhack Full-Stack Development Bootcamp. Here, I deepened my
                knowledge of web technologies and was also the 2020 recipient of
                the Ironhack Final Project Crowd Favorite Award.
                <br /> <br />
                Upon graduating from Ironhack, I've led a successful web
                development career in which my dedication, strong team skills,
                and design talent have earned me the position of frontend
                software engineer. I vow to bring these same qualities to every
                project I take on as I pursue this new future in blockchain,
                Web3, and continuing my growth in web development.
                <br /> <br />
                More recently in April of 2022, I participated in eMerge
                Americas x Ironhack 2022 Blockchain Hackathon in which my team
                won 1st place. <br /> <br /> I am well-versed in a multitude of
                web technologies including Javascript, React, Next.js, Express,
                MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and Tailwind.
